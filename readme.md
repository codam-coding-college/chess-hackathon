# Chess-bot hackathon
Lets make a competitive chess-bot!

## Context
Writing a chess-bot is a challenging, fun and educational experience. From
optimization and testing, to algorithms and debugging, there is a lot to learn
and do.

In this hackathon, you'll build a chess-bot that is capable of playing standard
chess, and at the end, have them compete against each other.

## Prizes
1st place in each league:
- The title "Grandmaster" on intra
- A Codam hoodie per teammate
- A trophy for the winning team
- 10k coalition points per teammate for the coalition they represent
- Bragging rights!

2nd place in each league:
- The title "International master" on intra
- A pair of socks per teammate
- 5k coalition points per teammate for the coalition they represent
- Bragging rights!

## Leagues
You might have already built many chess-bots, or this might be your first try.
To keep things fair, this hackathon has two leagues:

Minor:
	Recommended for people building their first chess-bot. You'll "only" have
	to program the evaluation function, which determines which moves is the
	best.

Major:
	Recommended for people who have experience with programming chess-bots,
	and/or are in for a challenge. You'll have to write everything from
	scratch(\*).

## Important rules:
Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of all the rules. More rules and
other information can be found on the GitHub page.

- Team compositions:
	- **Minor league:**	max 3 Codam students
	- **Major league:**	max 2 Codam students and/or alumni
- All code(\*) will have to be written during the event.
- All code(\*) must be written by your team and your team only. This means no
generative AI or asking a "friend" to write the code for you.
- No using already existing chess-bots(\*\*)
- Except the explicitly allowed libraries, the usage of libraries is not
allowed. This includes "standard libraries" which are included in some
programming languages. See the GitHub page for more info

\*=There are some libraries (like standard libraries, libraries for parsing
FENs, etc.) and boilerplate code that you'll be allowed to use, please see
the GitHub page for more info.
\*\*=The minor league will be allowed to use a chess-bot boilerplate provided by
us.
